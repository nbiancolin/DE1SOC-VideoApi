# DE1SOC-VideoApi

I made this for use in the course ECE243 at the University of Toronto (Computer organization & architecture). It is essentially a collection of helper functions to make using the VGA output easier. Forks / pull requests are welcome!

Written in C to be compiled into assemlbly and run on the DE1-SOC boards.
